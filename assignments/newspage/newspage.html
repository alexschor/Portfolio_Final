	<body>WASHINGTON — Pope Francis landed to a red-carpet welcome on Tuesday afternoon as he opened his first visit to the United States determined to press the world’s last superpower to do more to care for the planet and its most marginalized inhabitants.

	<p></p>The papal jet descended out of cloudy skies to touch down at Joint Base Andrews, the iconic post still better known as Andrews Air Force Base and home of the presidential air fleet. As he disembarked, his white robes flapping in the wind and his cap held in his hand, the pontiff was greeted by President Obama, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and their families.

	<p></p>Hundreds of guests invited mainly by the Apostolic Nunciature, the equivalent of an embassy, cheered as the Alitalia jet rolled along the runway and the pope made his way down the stairs. “Ho, ho, hey, hey, welcome to the U.S.A.,” they chanted at one point. At another, they chanted, “We love Francis, yes we do; We love Francis, how about you?”

	While he seemed a little weary as he arrived after his visit to Cuba, Pope Francis, 78, smiled broadly and seemed delighted to be here. Mr. Obama clapped, shook his hand and then introduced his wife, Michelle, his daughters Malia and Sasha, and his mother-in-law, Marian Robinson. Mr. Biden, the first Catholic vice president, did the same with his wife, Jill, and his granddaughters Maisy and Finnegan.

<h2>Los Angeles Puts $100 Million Into Helping Homeless</h2>

	<body>LOS ANGELES — Declaring the growing homeless population a public emergency, the Los Angeles City Council is planning to spend $100 million to help get people off the streets.

	<p></p>In announcing the plan, city officials said Tuesday that they would focus on paying for housing and other programs, including a proposal from Mayor Eric Garcetti to spend $13 million this year on short-term rental subsidies and other services.

	<p></p>Homeless encampments have increasingly appeared under freeway overpasses, in parks and on sidewalks across this sprawling city, where a majority of the estimated 26,000 homeless people live on the city’s streets and not in its shelters.

	<p></p>“This city has pushed this problem from neighborhood to neighborhood for too long, from bureaucracy to bureaucracy,” Mr. Garcetti said during a news conference in front of City Hall. “Every single day we come to work, we see folks lying on this grass, a symbol of our city’s intense crisis.”

	<p></p>The homeless population has increased about 12 percent since Mr. Garcetti took office in 2013. Like other mayors in large cities, Mr. Garcetti has pledged to end homelessness, but he has grappled with criticism that the city takes a heavy-handed approach to enforcement while doing too little to help people find and pay for housing. Budget officials have estimated that Los Angeles spends more than $100 million, mostly through law enforcement, to deal with issues that stem from people living on the streets.

	<p></p>The spending proposal is subject to approval by the City Council, and the money would be allocated by the council’s committee on homelessness and poverty. The $100 million figure was chosen in part for its symbolism, said Herb Wesson, the council president, and to make it clear to county, state and federal officials that the city was willing to contribute to solving an urgent problem.

	<p></p>“We wanted to send a message that we’re serious,” Mr. Wesson said. “Today, we step away from the insanity of doing the same thing and hoping for different results, and instead chart our way to ending homelessness.”
